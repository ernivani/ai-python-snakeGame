# Snake Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains a basic implementation of a reinforcement learning agent designed to play the Snake game. The agent employs a neural network to approximate Q-values for each possible action given a state. This model is trained using the Q-learning algorithm.

## Structure

- `nn.py`: Contains the neural network model. It's a simple feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers to approximate the Q-values.
  
- `snake.py`: Implements the mechanics of the Snake game, defines the environment's states, and contains the learning loop for the agent.

## Key Concepts

1. **State Definition**: The state of the environment is a combination of the x and y coordinates of the snake's head and the apple.

2. **Epsilon-Greedy Exploration**: The agent employs an epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration and exploitation.

3. **Reward System**: The agent receives:
    - Positive rewards for moving closer to the apple.
    - A significant reward for eating the apple.
    - A large negative reward for dying (either by hitting the wall or itself).

4. **Learning**: After accumulating a set amount of experiences (`batch_size`), the agent trains its neural network on this data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow

### Running the Agent

```bash
python snake.py
```

## Future Enhancements and Considerations

- **Experience Replay**: Introduce experience replay to allow the agent to learn from its past experiences more effectively.
  
- **Target Network**: Use a target network to stabilize learning.
  
- **Debugging and Visualization**: To understand the agent's learning progress, consider adding visualization tools or metrics to track its performance over time.
