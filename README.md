## **Snake Game AI**

# README NOT UP TO DATE

### **Description**

This repository contains an implementation of the classic Snake Game with an added twist: an AI player. Using neural networks and reinforcement learning, the AI tries to achieve the highest score possible while avoiding collisions.

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- Torch (PyTorch)

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ernivani/ai-python-snakeGame.git
   cd snake-game-ai
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **Usage**

1. To play the game manually:
   ```
   python snake.py
   ```

2. To train the AI:
   ```
   python snake.py --train
   ```

3. To let the trained AI play the game:
   ```
   python snake.py --ai
   ```

### **Features**

- Classic snake game mechanics.
- AI player trained using reinforcement learning.
- Ability to save and load the AI model for continued training.
- Graphical visualization of the game using Pygame.
